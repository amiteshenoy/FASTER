# Introduction

Managing large application state easily and with high performance is one of the hardest problems
in the cloud today. FASTER is a concurrent key-value store + cache that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage. It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency.

The following features of FASTER differentiate it from a technical perspective:
1. Latch-free cache-optimized index.
2. Unique “hybrid record log” design that combines a traditional persistent append-only log with in-place updates, to shape the memory working set and retain performance.
3. Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps. 
4. Asynchronous recovery model based on group commit.

For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See [the SIGMOD paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/faster-sigmod18.pdf) for more details. We also have a detailed
analysis of C# FASTER performance in a wiki page 
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23). The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER are very similar.
